I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab/research/" target="_blank">Dyson Robotics Lab</a> with Prof. Andrew Davison working on novel methods for real-time 3D motion estimation applied to specialised hardware. 
<!--
I did my PhD at the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" target="_blank">Edinburgh Center for Robotics</a> where I worked on visual SLAM applied to humanoid robots using sensor fusion and handling dynamic environments in visual SLAM by leveraging motion segmentation. My research interests are in real-time 3D perception methods which can robustly operate on mobile robotic platforms in real world conditions.
